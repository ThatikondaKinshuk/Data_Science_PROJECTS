## 🩺 **Disease Prediction Using Patient Data**

### 📖 **Overview**

The **Disease Prediction Using Patient Data** project leverages machine learning techniques to predict diseases based on patient features like medical history, symptoms, lab results, and more. This approach will help healthcare providers make early diagnoses and identify at-risk patients more effectively.

### 🚀 **Project Goals**

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand relationships between patient features and diseases.
2. **Model Development**: Build machine learning models to predict diseases.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Interactive Interface**: Develop a simple Python-based interactive interface to predict diseases.

---

### 🔑 **Features**

- **Dataset Download**: Automatically download the latest version of the dataset using `kagglehub`.
- **Exploration**: Visualize data distributions and correlations with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train and evaluate models like **Random Forest** to predict diseases.
- **Interactive Prediction**: Input patient data and get real-time predictions.

---

### 📊 **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the **Multiple Disease Prediction** dataset, which can be downloaded dynamically via `kagglehub`. The dataset includes patient details and their corresponding diseases.

### 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThatikondKinshuk/disease-prediction.git
   cd disease-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   The notebook will explore the dataset, build the model, and evaluate it.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/disease_prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run the Python Script for Prediction**:
   Use the interactive `input()` function to make predictions based on new data:
   ```bash
   python app/predict.py
   ```

### 🖥️ **Web App Interface**

The web app will allow users to input patient data and predict diseases. Here is a basic structure to start with:

#### **Input Form**
   - Collects data like age, gender, and symptoms from users.

#### **Prediction Results**
   - Shows disease prediction results after processing the input.

---

### 📚 **Model Training & Evaluation**

The project includes training and evaluating multiple models using the **Random Forest Classifier**. The evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

We also visualize the **Confusion Matrix** to gain insights into the model's performance.

#### Example Code for Evaluation:

```python
# Print classification report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Confusion matrix heatmap
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, cmap='Blues', fmt='g')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

---

### 📈 **Data Exploration & Visualization**

We provide interactive visualizations of the data, helping you understand relationships between features:

#### Example Code for Data Visualization:

```python
# Visualizing the distribution of the target variable (disease presence)
sns.countplot(x='disease', data=df)
plt.title('Disease Distribution')
plt.show()

# Visualizing correlations between features
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Interactive Predictions**

The interactive Python function allows users to enter new patient data and receive real-time predictions. Here's an example:

#### Example Code for Interactive Prediction:

```python
# Interactive function to make predictions
def predict_disease():
    print("Enter patient details:")
    features = []
    
    # Collecting inputs based on feature columns
    for col in X.columns:
        val = float(input(f"Enter value for {col}: "))
        features.append(val)
    
    # Make a prediction
    prediction = model.predict([features])[0]
    print(f"\n🔍 Predicted Disease: {prediction}")

# Run the interactive prediction
predict_disease()
```

### 🔑 **Key Insights**

- **Dataset Downloading**: Use KaggleHub to ensure you always have the latest version of the dataset.
- **Model Building**: Experiment with different models to find the one that best predicts the disease.
- **Visualization**: Use interactive visualizations to explore data and model performance.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Allow end-users to input data and receive predictions instantly.

---

### 📝 **Future Improvements**

- **Enhanced Web Interface**: Develop a complete web app with **Flask** or **Streamlit** for user-friendly interaction.
- **Model Enhancement**: Experiment with other models like **XGBoost** or **Neural Networks** for better performance.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model on cloud platforms like **AWS** or **Azure** for scalable predictions.
- **Real-Time Data Input**: Integrate data collection from wearables for real-time health predictions.

### ✨ **Animations for Visual Enhancement**

If you want to add animations or interactive visualizations to your **README.md**, consider embedding tools like **Plotly** for interactive graphs and animations or using animated GIFs to illustrate processes like model training or predictions.

For example, here’s a basic way to embed an animation of the model training process:

```html
<img src="path/to/your/animation.gif" alt="Model Training Animation">
```

If you're running the model training or evaluation in a Jupyter notebook, consider using the **`Plotly`** library for interactive plots.

Example:
```python
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.scatter(df, x="feature1", y="feature2", color="target")
fig.show()
```
