🩺 Disease Prediction Using Patient Data
🔍 Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of certain diseases based on patient data (e.g., age, medical history, symptoms, lab results). The aim is to assist healthcare professionals in making early diagnoses and identifying high-risk patients.

🚀 Project Goals
Data Exploration: Understand the relationships between patient features and diseases.
Model Building: Develop a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Deployment: Deploy the model via a web app for interactive use.
Interpretability: Provide model insights using explainable AI techniques.
📊 Dataset
We use publicly available datasets for disease prediction:

Heart Disease Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle)
Each dataset contains patient features like age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators.
